# Positive Unlabeled data simulation
To comprehensively assess the proposed method, we designed a series of simulation studies. Four different scenarios for the noise distribution are simulated that correspond to: population balanced with two classes well separated, or clear balanced scenario; population balanced with two classes not well separated, or noisy balance scenario; population unbalanced with two classes well separated, or clear unbalanced scenario; population unbalanced with two classes not well separated, or the noisy unbalanced scenario. The alteration of population unbalancedness and separation are achieved by designing different propensity score function as follows:

The function looks similar, but their non-linear properties are distinguished. Here we show the distribution of ùëÉùëü(ùëå = 1) for each of the scenarios. In addition, direction of the population unbalancedness is also altered, which either makes the positive instance the larger or smaller class.

## Usage
```
simul_data=PU_data_simulation(p=100,N=200,confident_rate=0.5,scenario='noisy_balance',valid='01')
```

## Arguments

* `train_data`: Gene expression matrix which has N samples and M variables

* `Label.obs`: Positive Unlabeled for each sample, 1 means true positive label, 0 means unlabeled labels

* `Sample_use_time`: Used in stop criteria, how many times each samples to be used in training process

* `l.rate`: Control how much information from last iteration will be used in next

* `qq`: Quantile of the probability for positive samples, used to determine the cutoff between positive and negtive

## Value
Result list contains three elements: `pred.y` shows the probability for each same to be predicted as positive; `cutoff` is the reference cutoff to transfer continues probability to binary 0/1 label; `pred.coef1` take the variable coefficient used in prediction model. 

## Example
```
### The R packages involved in PLUS package
library(PLUS)
library(glmnet)

X=PLUS::example_data$train_data
Label=PLUS::example_data$Label.obs
Prediction=PLUS(train_data=X,Label.obs=Label,Sample_use_time=30,l.rate=1,qq=0.1)
```
